			The Golden State Warriors are an American professional basketball team based in San Francisco. 
			The Warriors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA), as a member of the league's Western Conference Pacific 
			Division. Founded in 1946 in Philadelphia, the Warriors moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1962 and took the city's name, 
			before changing its geographic moniker to Golden State in 1971. The club plays its home games at the Chase Center.<br><br>
			I have been a fan of the Warriors since the "We Believe" season. I was even at the game where Baron Davis threw down his iconic
			baseline dunk against the Jazz in the only game of the series that we won. I have watched the organization grow and evolve over
			the years. At first, I was upset that Monte Ellis was traded, but my reaction quickly turned to joy once they had drafted Steph
			Curry, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson, forming the basis for a superteam that dominated the league for years.

			The San Francisco 49ers are a professional American football team based in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
			The 49ers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) West 
			division. The team plays its home games at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, located 38 miles (61 km) southeast of 
			San Francisco. The name "49ers" comes from the prospectors who arrived in Northern California in the 1849 Gold Rush.<br><br>
			The main reason why I am a huge 49ers fan, similar to the Warriors, is because I was born in the Bay Area. As a child, I went
			to many games at the old and iconic Candlestick Park. I even got to witness what was in my opinion one of the best and most 
			memorable NFC Championship games in history when the 49ers faced off against the Saints.

			The New York Yankees are an American professional baseball team based in the New York City borough of the Bronx. The Yankees 
			compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division. They are one of two major 
			league clubs based in New York City, the other being the National League's (NL) New York Mets. The Yankees began play in the 
			1901 season as the Baltimore Orioles (no relation to the modern Baltimore Orioles). In 1903, Frank Farrell and Bill Devery 
			purchased the franchise after it ceased operations and moved it to New York City, renaming the club the New York Highlanders. 
			The Highlanders were officially renamed the New York Yankees in 1913.<br><br>
			While I may not be from New York, the main reason that I am a fan of the Yankees is because my dad was a Yankees fan growing up.
			Also, of all the three main sports, I care about and follow baseball significantly less than basektball or football. Because of
			this, I also cheer for the local SF Giants whenever they play against a team other than the Yankees. You might think that my father
			is from New York because he was a Yankees fan growing up, but in fact, he just grew up so long ago during a time where the Yankees
			were the only team being broadcast on TV due to being the winningest franchise in baseball history by a landslide.
